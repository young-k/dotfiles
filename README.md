## Dotfiles

A general collection of my personal configurations for bash, zsh, vim, and emacs.

This repo should be cloned to the home directory, or `~`.

The explicit installation process for the emacs configuration can be found within the ```dotemacs``` folder.

For the vim/bash/zsh configs, you can just copy and paste them in the ```~``` directory, and use the ```source``` command to see the changes in effect.
